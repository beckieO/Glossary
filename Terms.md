# 2D Array
## KS4 
A static data structure that holds data both horizontally and vertically. The structure is fixed and each element has the same data type.


# 2D List
## KS4 
A dynamic data structure that holds data both horizontally and vertically. The structure can change during program execution and the data types of the elements can be different.


# A* Algorithm
## KS5
An algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes and uses a heuristic function to optimise performance.


# Abstract Data Type
## KS5
A conceptual model of the way that data is arranged and the operations that can be carried out on the data.


# Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
## KS5
A tree representation of the key constructs of a piece of source code, showing the order of evaluation.


# Abstraction
## KS2
A process of focusing on a specific aspect, whilst ignoring the wider context and/or some details 
## KS5
A set of techniques used to solve complex problems that involves removing unnecessary details so the main processes involved can be easily identified.
## BCS
Is removing unnecessary detail from a problem so the main processes involved can be more easily identified and understood.
